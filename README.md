# [WIP] Termux Setup

This is a script collection for easily setup multiple things in an Android
Termux environment.

The main goal is aid to prepare Termux with a proot environment with all the
needed software for running 32 and 64 bits x86 software, including
Windows applications, but you can execute only those scripts that you need.

NOTE: DON'T CLONE OR DOWNLOAD THIS REPO.
To start the setup process, run in Termux:

curl -O https://arithesage.github.io/setup-termux

or

curl -LO https://tinyurl.com/setup-termux

And then:
chmod +x ~/setup-termux
~/setup-termux

This will perform a basic Termux setup and also clone the repo.
