# [WIP] Termux Setup

This is a script collection for easily setup multiple things in an Android
Termux environment.

The main goal is aid to prepare Termux with a proot environment with all the
needed software for running 32 and 64 bits x86 software, including
Windows applications, but you can execute only those scripts that you need.
